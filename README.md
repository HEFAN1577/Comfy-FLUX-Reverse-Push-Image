# Comfy-FLUX-Reverse-Push-Image
"This plugin calls the gorq, llama-3.2-90b-vision-preview model. Gorq is currently free, and the image generation speed is extremely fast, taking only 1 second to generate an image. When combined with FLUX image generation, it's a blessing for low-configuration computers. To use this plugin, follow these steps:

1. Go to www.groq.com to apply for an API key.
2. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/HEFAN1577/comfy-groq_prompt_reverse.git
3. Create a new node and search for: groq_prompt_reverse to generate MD format."

Note: It appears that this plugin uses a specific model and requires an API key from the GROQ website. The user must also clone a repository and create a new node to use the plugin.
